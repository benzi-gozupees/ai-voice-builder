Perfect! I understand the clarifications. Let me confirm the updated implementation plan:

Updated Implementation Plan
1. Database Schema (industry_prompts table)
Create table with: id, industry, display_name, prompt_template, is_default, created_at, updated_at
Default Entry: Industry "others" with is_default = true containing the current master prompt template
Industry Entries: Pre-populate with all available industries from the existing constants, but with empty prompt_template fields (you'll fill these manually later)
Test Entries: Add 1-2 dummy prompts for testing functionality (which you'll replace later)
2. Backend Logic Changes
Keep tool instructions untouched: All existing calendar tool integration remains exactly as-is
Modify generateAssistantPrompt():
Add optional industrySlug parameter
Query industry_prompts table for matching industry
Fallback logic: If industry not found, has empty prompt, or any error occurs → use "others" (default) prompt
Safety: Always ensure a prompt is returned, never fail due to database issues
3. Frontend Updates
Quick Setup Form:
Add /api/industries endpoint returning { industry, display_name } from database
Replace static industry dropdown with database-driven options
Pass selected industry slug to assistant creation
Backward Compatibility: If no industry provided, system defaults to "others"
4. Admin Dashboard (/admin/prompts)
CRUD interface for managing industry prompts
Ability to edit prompt_template for each industry
Protection against deleting/changing the default "others" entry
Simple authentication check
Key Points Confirmed:
✅ All prompts stored in single industry_prompts table
✅ Default prompt goes in "others" industry with is_default = true
✅ Tool instructions system remains completely unchanged
✅ Pre-populate industries with empty prompts for manual completion
✅ Robust fallback to "others" prompt on any failure
✅ 1-2 test prompts for functionality verification
The flow will be: Industry selected → Query database → Use industry prompt OR fallback to "others" → Apply existing tool instructions as before.

Is this understanding correct? Should I proceed with implementation?
