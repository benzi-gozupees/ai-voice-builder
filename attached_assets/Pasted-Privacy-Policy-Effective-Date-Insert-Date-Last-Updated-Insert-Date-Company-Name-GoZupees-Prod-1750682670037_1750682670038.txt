1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how GoZupees (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, shares, and protects your personal information when you use our Voice Builder AI Assistant platform, including our integration with third-party services such as Google Calendar via OAuth 2.0 authorization.

We are committed to protecting user privacy, following industry best practices, and complying with applicable data protection laws and Google API Services User Data Policy.

2. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information:

a. OAuth Access Data (Google User Data)
If you authorize our application to access your Google Calendar:

We request OAuth 2.0 access only for the following scopes:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email

This allows us to:

View available time slots on your primary calendar

Book customer appointments into your calendar

Retrieve your email to associate calendar access with your tenant account

We do not access your full calendar history, email content, contacts, or any data outside the explicitly authorized scopes.

b. User-Provided Information
When signing up or configuring your assistant, you may provide:

Business name, location, industry

Contact email and phone number

Customer information (e.g. booking details during calls)

c. System Usage Data
We collect technical data including:

Assistant usage (calls, bookings)

Browser information and IP address

Timestamps of logins, logouts, and API requests

3. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected data to:

Enable AI assistant functionality (e.g., appointment scheduling via calendar)

Store and manage bookings, transcripts, and call metadata

Personalize assistant behavior based on your business settings

Provide dashboard-level insights and management tools

We do not sell or share user data with advertisers or unauthorized third parties.

4. Data Storage & Security
All OAuth tokens and user credentials are stored in encrypted format using AES-256 encryption.

Tokens are scoped per tenant and isolated at the account level.

We implement TLS encryption for all data in transit and enforce strong access controls for backend infrastructure.

No raw calendar data or event history is stored unless explicitly created by the AI assistant.

You can revoke access to Google Calendar at any time from your dashboard, which deletes all associated tokens and disables further sync access.

5. Data Retention
Call logs and appointment data are retained only as long as needed for operational and compliance purposes.

You may request data deletion at any time by contacting our support team at privacy@gozupees.com.

6. User Controls & Consent
Users must explicitly grant calendar access via OAuth consent screen.

Users may disconnect calendar access at any time from within their account dashboard.

All assistant behavior is configurable and editable via the dashboard.

7. Children's Privacy
Our platform is intended for business users only and is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from children.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Material changes will be notified via email or a banner on the dashboard.
